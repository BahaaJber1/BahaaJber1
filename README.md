# 👋 Hi, I'm Bahaa

I'm a web developer and IT graduate with a passion for building tools that make life easier, clearer, and more manageable. I work mostly with Node.js and modern JavaScript frameworks, and I'm driven by the idea that good code can empower people, especially when it’s designed with empathy and purpose.

## 🌍 A Little About Me

- 👨‍💻 I'm focused on full-stack web development using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and a clean, modular approach to building APIs and UIs.  
- 💬 I care deeply about building systems that are not only efficient but respectful of human needs, whether in education, mental health, or day-to-day productivity.  
- 🧠 I'm currently researching how wearable **IoT devices** can help detect early signs of stress and fatigue. This is an academic project grounded in real-world problems, and while it's still under development, it’s a topic I feel personally connected to.  
- 🌱 Outside of code, I'm working on myself—building self-confidence, managing anxiety, and learning to approach life with more calm and clarity.

## 🚀 What I'm Working On

### 📚 College Assistant (Flask → Node.js)
A smart study planner that helps university students track completed courses and receive personalized study plans. Originally built with Flask, now being refactored using Node.js and Express for better structure and scalability.

### 🧠 IoT for Mental Health (Research Paper)
An academic research project exploring how wearable sensors can monitor stress and fatigue in real-time using physiological data. The device is still in concept phase but grounded in meaningful goals: prevention, awareness, and early intervention.

## 🎯 Goals for 2025

- 🎥 Launch a YouTube series on Git, GitHub, and version control workflows  
- 🔐 Get deeper into web security and ethical development practices  
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Collaborate on open-source Node.js and Express projects  
- 🧰 Build a portfolio of real tools that genuinely help people

## 🧭 Philosophy

> _"Code is more than syntax—it's a language of care, design, and responsibility."_

Whether I’m building a backend or writing a research paper, I believe in intentional, human-centered work. Tech isn’t just what we build—it’s how we show up for others through our tools.
