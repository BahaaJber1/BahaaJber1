# 👋 Hi, I'm **Bahaa** 

I’m a web developer and recent IT graduate who’s always been drawn to solving problems in practical, meaningful ways. For me, code isn’t just about functionality, it’s about **helping** people feel less overwhelmed and more in control of their digital lives. I enjoy working with **Node.js, React** and modern JavaScript frameworks, but what really drives me is building things that actually make a difference. Whether it’s simplifying a task, organizing information, or creating clarity where there was confusion—I want my work to matter, and I want it to *feel* human.

## 🌍 A Little About Me

- 👨‍💻 I'm focused on full-stack web development using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **React**, and a clean, modular approach to building APIs and UIs.  
- 💬 I care deeply about building systems that are not *only* **efficient but respectful of human needs**, whether in education, mental health, or day-to-day productivity.  
- 🧠 I finished my research about how wearable **IoT devices** can help detect early signs of stress and fatigue. This is an academic project grounded in real-world problems, and it’s a topic I feel personally **connected** to. 
- 🌱 Outside of code, I'm working on myself—building self-confidence, managing anxiety, and learning to approach life with more calm and clarity.

## 🧭 Philosophy

> _"Code is more than syntax—it's a language of care, design, and responsibility."_

Whether I’m building a backend or writing a research paper, I believe in intentional, human-centered work. Tech isn’t just what we build—it’s how we show up for others through our tools.
